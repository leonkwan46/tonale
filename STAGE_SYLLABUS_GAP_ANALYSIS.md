# Stage Syllabus Gap Analysis - Missing Topics

## Overview

This document identifies **missing topics** from your planned stage syllabus compared to ABRSM Grade 1-3 requirements. Topics are organized by grade and category.

---

## GRADE 1 - Missing Topics

### ✅ **Well Covered**
- Note & Rest Values (semibreve, minim, crotchet, quaver, semiquaver)
- Dotted notes (quaver, crotchet, minim)
- Time Signatures (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, C)
- Treble & Bass Clef Notes
- Dynamics (p, pp, mp, mf, f, ff, crescendo, diminuendo)
- Articulation (staccato, legato, accent, pause/fermata)
- Major Keys (C, G, D, F)
- Intervals (2nd-8ve above tonic)
- Tonic Triads
- Basic Italian Terms (tempo, expression, performance)

### ❌ **Missing or Unclear Coverage**

#### **1. Signs & Symbols**
**Partially Covered:**
- Slur, tie, staccato, accent, pause - ✅ Covered
- Crescendo/diminuendo signs - ✅ Covered as symbols

**Note:** Metronome indications and repeat marks are being skipped per project requirements.

#### **2. Scale Degrees**
**Missing:**
- **Degrees of scale (1st-8th)** - Required to identify degrees within one octave and above the tonic
- **Semitones and tones** - Required knowledge for Grade 1

**Your Plan:** You mention intervals but not explicitly teaching scale degrees as a concept.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit teaching of scale degrees (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) and the difference between semitones and tones. This should be in Stage 2 before or alongside intervals.

#### **3. Sharps, Flats, Naturals**
**Unclear:**
- **Explicit teaching of accidentals** - While notes are covered, the ABRSM requirement specifically mentions "sharps, flats, naturals" as a learning objective

**Your Plan:** Accidentals are likely covered in clef note lessons, but not explicitly called out as a separate topic.

**Recommendation:** Make accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals) an explicit subtopic when teaching pitches.

#### **4. Whole-Bar Rests**
**Missing:**
- **Whole-bar rest** - Required for Grade 1 but not explicitly mentioned in your rest values section

**Your Plan:** You list semiquaver through semibreve rests, but the ABRSM also requires "whole-bar rest" which is context-dependent (fills entire bar regardless of time signature).

**Recommendation:** Add whole-bar rests to the rest values lesson in Stage 1.

#### **5. Italian Terms - Completeness Check**
**Covered in your plan:**
- ✅ a tempo, accelerando, adagio, allegretto, allegro, andante
- ✅ cantabile, crescendo, decrescendo, diminuendo, dolce
- ✅ da capo (D.C.), fine, al fine
- ✅ rallentando, ritardando
- ✅ legato, staccato

**Missing from your listed terms:**
- **moderato** - Listed in Grade 1 but not in your Stage 2 term list

**Recommendation:** Ensure moderato is included in your Italian terms coverage.

## GRADE 2 - Missing Topics

### ✅ **Well Covered**
- New time signatures (3/8, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2, alla breve)
- Triplets (semiquavers, quavers, crotchets, minims)
- Ledger lines extension
- Relative major/minor keys
- Minor scales (harmonic)
- New major keys (A, B♭, E♭)
- Italian terms (most)

### ❌ **Missing or Unclear Coverage**

#### **1. Signs & Symbols**
**Missing:**
- **Strong accent** - Required for Grade 2 (different from regular accent)
- **Semi-staccato** - Required for Grade 2
- **Staccatissimo** - Required for Grade 2
- **Tenuto** - Required for Grade 2
- **8va (ottava)** - Required for Grade 2

**Your Plan:** You mention "tenuto" in Stage 1, but other Grade 2 signs are missing.

**Note:** Multiple-bar rests and volta brackets are being skipped per project requirements.

**Recommendation:** Add a comprehensive lesson on "Advanced Articulation Signs" covering strong accent, semi-staccato, staccatissimo, tenuto, and 8va. This should be in Stage 1 (Grade 2 Foundation).

#### **2. Transposition Type**
**Unclear:**
- **"At the same pitch"** - Grade 2 requires transposition where notes are written at the same pitch in treble and bass clefs (not octave transposition)

**Your Plan:** You mention "Transposition at the Octave" but Grade 2 specifically requires "at the same pitch" transposition, which is different from octave transposition.

**Recommendation:** Clarify that Grade 2 Stage 1 should cover "same pitch" transposition (treble ↔ bass clef equivalents), while Grade 3 covers octave transposition.

#### **3. Rests**
**Missing:**
- **Dotted semibreve rest** - Required for Grade 2 but not explicitly mentioned

**Your Plan:** You cover dotted notes but dotted semibreve rest is specifically required.

**Recommendation:** Add dotted semibreve rest to dotted rests lesson in Stage 2.

#### **4. Intervals - Beyond One Octave**
**Unclear:**
- **Degrees of scale beyond one octave** - Grade 2 requirement: "degrees of scale beyond one octave, above the tonic"

**Your Plan:** You mention intervals but not specifically teaching degrees beyond one octave.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit teaching of scale degrees beyond one octave (e.g., 9th, 10th, etc.) in Stage 2.

#### **5. Italian Terms - Completeness Check**
**Need to verify all Grade 2 terms are covered:**
- ✅ alla marcia, allargando, con moto, con/col, dal segno (D.S.), e/ed
- ✅ espressivo, fp (fortepiano), grave, grazioso, largo, lento
- ✅ ma, meno, meno mosso, molto, non troppo, più, più mosso
- ✅ poco/poco a poco, presto, ritenuto/riten./rit., senza, vivace/vivo

**Recommendation:** Verify all Grade 2 terms are explicitly listed in your Stage 2 lesson on Italian terms.

## GRADE 3 - Missing Topics

### ✅ **Well Covered**
- Compound time signatures (6/8, 9/8, 12/8)
- Demisemiquaver notes
- Extended ledger lines (up to three)
- Melodic & harmonic minor scales
- Interval quality (M/m/P)
- Octave transposition
- Most Italian terms

### ❌ **Missing or Unclear Coverage**

#### **1. Rests**
**Missing:**
- **Demisemiquaver rest** - Required for Grade 3
- **Dotted semiquaver rest** - Required for Grade 3
- **Simple or compound time** - Rests should be taught in context of both simple and compound time

**Your Plan:** You mention demisemiquaver but not explicitly the rest version.

**Recommendation:** Add demisemiquaver rest and dotted semiquaver rest to Stage 2 (Grade 3 Complete).

#### **2. Intervals - Quality Specification**
**Partially Covered:**
- ✅ Major 2nd, Minor/Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th
- ✅ Minor/Major 6th, Minor/Major 7th, Perfect 8ve

**Your Plan:** You mention "Intervals (with quality)" which is good, but need to ensure all specific interval types are covered.

**Recommendation:** Verify all interval types from Grade 3 requirements are explicitly taught:
- Major 2nd
- Minor 3rd, Major 3rd
- Perfect 4th
- Perfect 5th
- Minor 6th, Major 6th
- Minor 7th, Major 7th
- Perfect 8ve

#### **3. Scale Degrees - Above/Below Tonic**
**Missing:**
- **Degrees of scale above OR below the tonic** - Grade 3 requirement

**Your Plan:** You cover intervals but not explicitly teaching scale degrees below the tonic.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit teaching of scale degrees below the tonic (e.g., in bass clef, identifying degrees descending from tonic).

#### **4. Upbeat Opening**
**Missing:**
- **Upbeat opening** - Listed under Grade 3 time signatures but not explicitly mentioned

**Your Plan:** Not mentioned.

**Recommendation:** Add "upbeat opening" (anacrusis) to compound time lesson or create a separate concept for understanding pieces that start on an upbeat.

#### **5. Melodic vs Harmonic Minor Scales**
**Partially Covered:**
- ✅ You mention both melodic and harmonic minor scales

**Unclear:**
- **Ascending vs Descending** - Melodic minor scales have different ascending and descending patterns
- **When to use which** - Students need to understand when to apply melodic vs harmonic minor

**Recommendation:** Ensure melodic minor scales are taught with both ascending (raised 6th & 7th) and descending (natural form) patterns clearly explained.

#### **6. Major Keys - Complete List**
**Need to verify:**
- Your plan says "Up to 4 sharps/flats: C, G, D, A, E, F, B♭, E♭, A♭ Major"
- **Grade 3 requirement:** E and A♭ major (new for Grade 3)
- All previous keys should be cumulative (C, G, D, F from Grade 1; A, B♭, E♭ from Grade 2; E, A♭ from Grade 3)

**Recommendation:** Verify all major keys are covered cumulatively.

#### **7. Minor Keys - Complete List**
**Need to verify:**
- Your plan lists: A, E, D, G, C, F, B, G, C, F#
- **Grade 3 requirement:** C#, F, B, G, C, F# minor
- **Note:** You may have duplicates or missing keys in your list

**Recommendation:** Verify complete list matches:
- From Grade 2: A, E, D minor
- From Grade 3: C#, F, B, G, C, F# minor

#### **8. Italian Terms - Completeness Check**
**Need to verify all Grade 3 terms:**
- ✅ agitato, andantino, animato, ben, con forza, energico
- ✅ giocoso, leggiero, maestoso, pesante, prestissimo
- ✅ prima/primo, risoluto, scherzando, semplice, sempre
- ✅ sfz/sf, simile/sim., subito/sub., tranquillo
- ✅ marcato/marc., sforzando/sforzato, sostenuto/sost., triste/tristamente

**Recommendation:** Verify all terms are explicitly covered in your Stage 2 Italian terms lesson.

## Notes

- Most of your syllabus is well-structured and covers the major topics
- The main gaps are in **signs & symbols**, **scale degrees**, and **rest values**
- Some topics are covered but need to be **explicitly stated** rather than assumed
- Transposition needs clarification between Grade 2 and Grade 3 requirements
- **Skipped topics (per project requirements):** Metronome indications, repeat marks (Grade 1), multiple-bar rests, volta brackets (Grade 2)
