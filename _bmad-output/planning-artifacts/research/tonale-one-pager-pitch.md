## **The Problem Music Teachers Face**

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**❌ Students Practice Wrong**
- Can't see what happens between lessons
- Discover gaps too late
- Inefficient practice patterns compound

**❌ Existing Tools Don't Help Teachers**
- ABRSM apps: "Limited teacher oversight"
- Fragmented: 4 apps needed (£19.96)
- Poor mobile UX, no progress tracking

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**❌ Manual Tracking is Exhausting**
- 2-3 hours/week on admin
- Spreadsheets, paper workbooks
- No data for parent conversations

**❌ Workbooks are Expensive & Wasteful**
- £12-20 per student per grade
- No way to verify completion
- No instant feedback for students
