## The Problem: What Music Teachers Face Today

### 1. **Exam Anxiety is Costing Your Students Success**

Research shows that nervousness is extremely common among ABRSM students, with learners experiencing:
- Dry mouth, sweaty hands, and shakes
- Music theory feeling like "such a scary subject"
- Significant psychological barriers to exam success

**The Impact on You:**
- Lower pass rates affect your reputation
- Anxious students require more one-on-one time
- Parents become concerned and may switch teachers

### 2. **Students Practice Inefficiently Without Oversight**

Students struggle with:
- Breaking practice into focused segments (they cram everything into one long session)
- Identifying and correcting technical flaws early
- Progressive difficulty as grades increase

**The Impact on You:**
- You can't monitor daily practice between lessons
- Weak foundations cascade into future grades
- More lesson time spent correcting bad habits

### 3. **Existing Tools Don't Support Teachers**

Current ABRSM apps and tools have critical gaps:
- **Limited teacher oversight**: Official ABRSM apps have "limited facility for teachers to oversee and offer external feedback"
- **Fragmented ecosystem**: Separate apps for theory, aural, scales, sight-reading (£4.99 each = £19.96 total)
- **Poor mobile experience**: Tiny fonts, iPad-focused design
- **No progress tracking**: You can't see what students are actually practising

**The Impact on You:**
- No visibility into student preparation between lessons
- Can't assign specific practice or track completion
- Difficult to demonstrate value to parents
- Administrative overhead managing multiple tools

### 4. **Physical Workbooks Are Expensive & Wasteful**

Traditional workbooks cost £12-20 per student per grade, but:
- No way to track if students complete them
- Can't see where students are struggling
- No instant feedback for students
- Paper waste and logistical hassle
