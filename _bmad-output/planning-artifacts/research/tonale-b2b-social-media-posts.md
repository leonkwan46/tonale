### Post 1: Problem-Focused (Hook + Statistics)
**Format:** Text post with eye-catching statistic
**Best Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM

```
🎵 Music Teachers: How much time are you losing to admin?

Recent research shows music teachers spend 2-3 hours EVERY WEEK on:
• Manually tracking student progress
• Creating practice assignments
• Generating reports for parents
• Following up on who's actually practising

That's 104-156 hours per year. What could you do with that time?

Tonalè Classroom automates all of this, giving you real-time student oversight in a dashboard that actually works.

✨ First 10 schools get FREE 3-month pilot access ✨

Are you ready to reclaim your time?

We built the teacher tools that should have existed all along.

ABRSM's official apps have "limited facility for teachers to oversee students" (App Store review). We fixed that.

Tonalè Classroom = Complete ABRSM Grades 1-3 + Full Teacher Dashboard

£15.99/month for up to 25 students. That's £0.64 per student.

Compare that to £12-20 per workbook with zero tracking.

📊 The Music Education Market is Growing at 14.8% Annually

The total addressable market for online music education will reach £5.4 BILLION by 2030.

But here's what matters to you as a music teacher:

✅ 70% of students want to learn an instrument (huge demand)
✅ Mobile-first learning is growing 17.1% in Asia Pacific
✅ Well-managed music schools achieve 10-30% profit margins
✅ Top-tier schools exceed £568K/year in revenue

The schools winning are those adopting modern teaching tools.

Are you positioning your school for this growth?

Tonalè Classroom helps you:
→ Manage more students efficiently
→ Improve pass rates with data insights
→ Reduce admin time by 2-3 hours/week
→ Provide modern, mobile-first learning

FREE 3-month pilot for qualifying music schools.

### Post 4: Comparison/Competitive (Positioning)
**Format:** Text post with comparison table image
**Best Time:** Tuesday, 9 AM

```
Let's talk about the ABRSM app elephant in the room.

I'm a music teacher. I tried using the official ABRSM apps with my students. Here's what I discovered:

❌ Four separate apps needed (£19.96 total)
❌ "Limited facility for teachers to oversee" - actual App Store review
❌ Tiny fonts on mobile, clearly designed for iPad
❌ No way to see what students are actually practising
❌ No progress tracking across your class

So I built what I wished existed: Tonalè Classroom.

✅ Complete ABRSM Grades 1-3 in ONE platform
✅ Full teacher dashboard with real-time oversight
✅ Mobile-first design (where students actually practice)
✅ Class-wide analytics and performance trends
✅ £15.99/month for up to 25 students

Am I biased? Absolutely.
Am I solving a real problem teachers face? Ask the 50+ teachers in our pilot.

14-day FREE trial. No credit card. No obligation.

P.S. - I'm not saying the ABRSM apps are bad. I'm saying teachers need more than they provide.

Why I Built Tonalè: A Music Teacher's Confession

I'll never forget Sarah (not her real name).

Talented Grade 2 student. Practised diligently. But something wasn't clicking with theory.

She'd come to lessons each week saying "I did the workbook pages you assigned."

But when I'd check? Rushed, incomplete, fundamental misunderstandings compounding.

The problem wasn't Sarah. The problem was me.

I had no way to see WHAT she was practising or HOW she was struggling between our weekly lessons.

By the time I discovered the gaps, they'd become chasms.

That's the day I decided to build Tonalè.

Not just another app for students.
But a tool that actually helps TEACHERS teach better.

Now, teachers in our pilot tell me:
→ "I catch misunderstandings immediately, not weeks later"
→ "I finally know who's actually practising"
→ "My pass rates have improved because I can intervene early"

If you've ever felt like you're teaching in the dark between lessons...

You're not alone. And there's a better way.

Built by a teacher who gets it. For teachers who deserve better tools.

Quick question for ABRSM teachers 🎵

How do you currently track student practice between lessons?

A) Paper workbooks (hope they complete them)
B) Official ABRSM apps (students practice independently)
C) Honour system (ask "did you practice?")
D) Digital tools with teacher dashboard

Curious to hear what's working (or not working) for you!

Comment below - and if you're frustrated with your current system, let me know. I might have a solution to share 😊

FREE DOWNLOAD: ABRSM Student Progress Tracking Template 📊

Fellow music teachers, I created a simple spreadsheet to help you track:
✓ Lesson completion by topic
✓ Star ratings per grade level
✓ Practice time logs
✓ Parent report generation

Hundreds of teachers are using this to stay organised.

Comment "TEMPLATE" below and I'll DM you the link!

(P.S. - If spreadsheets aren't your thing, I also built an app that does all this automatically. But the template is a great start if you prefer manual tracking 😊)

### Post 8: Student Success Story (Emotional Hook)
**Format:** Short story + student result (anonymised)
**Best Time:** Wednesday, 3-5 PM

```
This message from a parent made my week 💙

"Thank you for recommending Tonalè! My daughter actually ASKS to practice theory now. She earned all 5 stars on her last lesson and was so proud. Her confidence for the Grade 1 exam has completely changed."

Exam anxiety is real for ABRSM students.

When students can practice at their own pace, get instant feedback, and see their progress visually... everything changes.

They go from "I have to practice theory 😩" to "Can I do one more lesson? 🤩"

That's the power of making learning feel like progress, not punishment.

If your students struggle with theory motivation, let's chat.

2/ But here's the problem:

Most tools are built for STUDENTS

Only 1 in 10 music education apps have proper TEACHER oversight features

Teachers are adopting tech, but feeling unsupported
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
3/ What teachers actually need:

✓ Real-time student progress visibility
✓ Class-wide analytics (spot trends)
✓ Ability to assign specific practice
✓ Parent reporting automation

Not just "another app for students to use"
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
4/ The result when teachers have proper tools:

→ 2-3 hours/week saved on admin
→ Early intervention prevents student struggles
→ Higher pass rates = better reputation
→ Parent satisfaction = better retention
```

```
Thank you! 🎵 That's exactly why we built this. Music teachers deserve tools that actually help them teach better. Have you had a chance to try the free trial yet? Would love your feedback!
```

### Question About Pricing
```
Great question! It's £15.99/month for up to 25 students (£0.64/student), or £159/year for schools (50-student tier). Compare that to £12-20 per physical workbook with no tracking. Want to see a demo? DM me!

The ABRSM apps are solid for student practice! What we add is the teacher layer - real-time oversight, class analytics, assigned practice tracking. Many teachers use both. Want to see how they work together? [demo link]
```

### Interest But Not Ready
```
Totally understand! No pressure. If you'd like, I can send you our free teacher resource pack (progress tracking templates, parent communication tips). Just DM me "RESOURCES" 😊
