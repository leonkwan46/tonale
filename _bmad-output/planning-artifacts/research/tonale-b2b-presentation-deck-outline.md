## Presentation Delivery Tips

### Opening (First 2 Minutes - Critical!)
1. **Hook with empathy:** "How many of you have spent Sunday evening manually tracking student progress?"
2. **Establish credibility:** "I'm a music teacher just like you, and I was frustrated with..."
3. **Promise value:** "In the next 15 minutes, I'll show you how to save 2-3 hours per week while improving student results."

### Middle (Body - Build Momentum)
1. **Use rule of three:** Problem → Solution → Proof
2. **Show, don't tell:** Demo screenshots, not just bullet points
3. **Pause for impact:** After key statistics, pause 2-3 seconds
4. **Interactive moments:** "How many of you...?" (show of hands)

### Closing (Last 2 Minutes - Drive Action)
1. **Recap value:** "Remember: £0.27-0.64 per student, full teacher dashboard, 2-3 hours saved per week"
2. **Remove friction:** "Free trial, no credit card, no obligation"
3. **Create urgency (softly):** "The first 10 schools get extended support during pilot"
4. **Clear CTA:** "Scan the QR code now, or come see me after"

### Q&A Strategy
**Common Objections:**
1. **"We already use ABRSM apps"** → "Great! How's the teacher oversight working for you?"
2. **"Budget constraints"** → "Compare £0.27/month to £12-20 workbooks plus your time"
3. **"Need to discuss with colleagues"** → "Perfect! Let's set up a demo for your whole team"
4. **"What about data privacy?"** → Have backup slide ready, emphasise GDPR compliance

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Colour Palette
- **Primary:** Deep blue (#1E40AF) - trust, professionalism
- **Secondary:** Purple (#6D28D9) - creativity, music
- **Accent:** Warm orange (#F59E0B) - calls to action
- **Background:** White/light grey - readability

### Typography
- **Headlines:** Bold, sans-serif (Montserrat, Helvetica Bold)
- **Body:** Clean, readable (Open Sans, Arial)
- **Minimum size:** 24pt for body text (18pt for citations)

### Imagery
- **High-quality photos:** Real teachers and students (not stock photos if possible)

- **Icons:** Consistent style (line icons or solid, not mixed)
- **Musical elements:** Subtle (treble clef watermarks, staff line dividers)

### Layout Principles

- One pricing slide (15 only)
- Strong CTA focus (slide 22)

### For Individual Private Tutors (1-on-1, Conversational)
- Use deck as visual aid, not script

### For Parent Information Evening (20 Minutes)
- Reframe: "How This Helps Your Child"
